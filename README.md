# My First Hackathon Project

## Overview
This is my submission for FreeTail Hacker's HackTX 2024 event. 

### Purpose of the Video Game
This is intended to be a video game where the player takes the role of a recently hired agent for the Cybercrime Resolution Intervention Agency (CRIA, for short) to stop cyberattacks launched by the large cybercriminal organization Majhack. You, the player, shall learn about machine learning techniques and apply them by programming in the game's custom Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to help the agency stop the cyberattacks. 

This video game doesn't require players to have any understanding and/or experience with programming with machine learning in Python.

### Video Game Story Direction and Vision
Recently hired to be an agent for the Cybercrime Resolution Intervention Agency, you are introduced to your mentor colleague Alexo Wraith and his AI cat companion Pappy who will help you get used to programming in Python in a in-game exclusive Interactive Development Environment that is a simplified version of Visual Studio Code. 

Your colleagues will aid you in getting used to the in-game exclusive Interactive Development Environment (IDE, for short), the action of programming in Python, and using Python libraries for machine learning techniques to stop cyberattacks. They are this game's core gameplay. Since this game's core gameplay resembles programming in Visual Studio Code or other IDEs in real life, the skills you develop while playing this game will be immediately useful in your programming career. 

In future chapters, the cybercriminal organization Majhack will launch cyberattacks against a variety of institutions. This provides you, the player, the opportunity to learn how machine learning techniques are applied in a variety of fields ranging from research to social media algorithms to stock market and fraud detection and practice them while you are out there stopping cyberattacks in the game!
